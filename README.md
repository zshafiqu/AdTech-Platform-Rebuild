#### Summary:

In the summer of 2019, I interned at Pandora in Oakland as a SWE intern on the Ad Technology Operations team. My project was to redesign and rebuild an older platform that was used daily across multiple teams called the Ad Tech Ops Tools platform.

This platform consisted of a set of tools that were used to help the end user's efficiency, stuff such as a form to submit tickets to JIRA and a page to translate ad services pixels. The primary issue was that the old tool was out of date, and a lot of the original functionality was not working as it should.

Throughout my ten weeks at Pandora, I was able to design and build a new platform for the team that transformed the end user experience. I met with team members across various orgs to collect user stories and feedback on what features needed to be implemented. The end result was a modularly designed component based platform that made updates and maintenance easy for the Ad Tech Ops team.

#### Documentation

In addition to building a new platform, the other part of my project was drafting documentation that a non-engineering team could use to maintain and update the platform. [Check out the manual I created here!](https://github.com/zshafiqu/adTech/blob/master/docs/assets/readMeStuff/docs.pdf)

#### Project Presentation

At the end of my internship I also gave a presentation of the project. Here's a copy of the poster I created that gives a high level overview!
